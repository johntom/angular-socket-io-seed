# Angular Socket.io Seed

This fork is for testing angular 1.0.4 with angular.ui and bootstrap.

## How to use it

Clone the angular-socket-io-seed repository and start hacking!

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js

### Running tests

Coming soon!

### Receiving updates from upstream

Just fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.

## Example Application

I created a [simple instant messaging application](https://github.com/btford/angular-socket-io-im)
and wrote a [blog post](http://briantford.com/blog/angular-socket-io.html) walking through the app to
illustrate using the seed.
